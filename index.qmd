I am currently a PhD candidate at the [School of Public Policy](https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/spp), Oregon State University and a consultant in the Office of Evaluation, [International Fund for Agricultural Development](https://www.ifad.org/en/) (IFAD). I am a development economist with interests in economics of education, labor, program evaluation, and research ethics.

My dissertation primarily focuses on education policy and its effects on educational attainment and labor market outcomes, including child labor. My job market paper examines policy implementation failures in India's education system, demonstrating how the non-implementation of the Right to Education Act excluded 300,000 children annually from schooling, resulting in substantial lifetime wage penalties (46% earnings gap). You can read more about my current research [here](https://sayakkhatua.github.io/research/research.html).

Prior to OSU, I worked as an Evaluation Specialist for the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), on transparency, reproducibility and ethical evidence (TREE) and managed international development projects across Asia and Africa. I also co-founded the Data innovations group at 3ie, which works on pushing the frontiers of evaluation research by using innovative methodologies and data.

**I am on the 2025-26 job market.** You can access my CV [here](https://sayakkhatua.github.io/cv/cv.html).

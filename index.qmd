My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of development economics, education, labor, migration, program evaluation, and research ethics.

Previously, I worked as an Evaluation Specialist for the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), on transparency, reproducibility and ethical evidence (TREE) and managed international development projects across Asia and Africa. I also co-founded the Data innovations group at 3ie, which works on pushing the frontiers of evaluation research by using innovative methodologies and data.
